# **PROJECT IRMINSUL**

Project Irminsul (aka Genshin Impact Reference Sheet 3.0) is the next evolution of my React-based *Genshin Impact* database websites. Version 1.0 and 2.0 can be found here: 
- [v1.0](https://bcheung98.github.io/genshin-impact-reference-sheet/) 
- [v2.0](https://bcheung98.github.io/genshin-impact-reference-sheet-2.0/)

The website lists all playable characters from *Genshin Impact*, their element, weapon, rarity, and the materials need to level up each character. Thanks to a handy [script](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) I found, I was able to implement multi-page functionality on GitHub Pages. Using this, the website now displays indivdual character data on their own page. This page includes character stats, ascension information, talents, constellations, and other miscellaneous data. 
I also plan to expand the database by including weapons, banner archives, and much more.
